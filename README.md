Repo for cruelty free project

For anyone looking at this, you will not see plotly express graphs rendered.  I had "fixed" this using plotly.io renderers, but then they were no longer interactive in the notebook, so I changed it back.

Things that still need done:
- merge dataframes on companies (not consistent so will need some work) - DONE!
- make dashboard with Dash (or maybe Streamlit) to help people find specific brands and where to purchase them











Used the contact form (6/6/22) on Logical Harmony to send this:
Hi Tashina!  
I've been working with the data on your site for a few days now as a data science project.  I have a comprehensive csv file with all brands from your main list page, and the 5 pages for Sephora, Ulta, etc.  I'm using it in my portfolio. Here's the link - https://mhapich.github.io - and the link on that page will take you to the repo with the csv if you'd like to take a look. I wanted to thank you for all of your hard work!! I go to your site regularly before I buy a new product. I also wanted to let you know that I'm working on a dashboard where people can go and interact with the data to find out information about a brand, or search through black-owned brands, etc. That link will also be on my portfolio.  Ideally, I want people to be able to click to purchase at one of the retailers listed. If I get that working, I will use your affiliate links instead of the company link.  Hopefully this is all okay with you. Please email me if you'd like me to include anything else in my work.  
Thanks! 
Michelle
