For anyone looking at this, you will not see plotly express graphs rendered.  I had "fixed" this using plotly.io renderers, but then they were no longer interactive in the notebook, so I changed it back.

Things that still need done:
- merge dataframes on companies (not consistent so will need some work)
- make dashboard with Dash to help people find specific brands and where to purchase them
